where :

Lookup_value – Lookup_value specifies the value that we want to look up in the first column of a table.
Table_array – The table array is the data array that is to be searched. The VLOOKUP function searches in the left-most column of this array.
Col_index_num – This is an integer, specifying the column number of the supplied table_array, that you want to return a value from.
Range_lookup – This defines what this function should return in the event that it does not find an exact match to the lookup_value. The argument can be set to TRUE or FALSE, which means:
                                 TRUE – Approximate match, that is, if an exact match is not found, use the closest match below the lookup_value.
                                 FALSE – Exact match, that is, if an exact match not found, then it will return an error.
